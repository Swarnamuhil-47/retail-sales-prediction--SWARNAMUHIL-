#Title
Retail sales prediction
#Absract
This project enhances claim prediction by integrating ensemble learning and explainable 
AI to predict the likelihood of insurance claims and detect potential fraud. By combining 
policy holder demographics, financial data, and claim history, the system produces 
interpretable results using SHAP and LIME, enabling insurers to make transparent, data
driven decisions.
#Main Objective 
To design and implement a robust machine learning framework that accurately 
predicts retail store sales, supports inventory planning, and provides interpretable insights for 
decision-making.

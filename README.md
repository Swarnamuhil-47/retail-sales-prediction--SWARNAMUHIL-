# Retail Store Sales Prediction

## Abstract
This project focuses on predicting retail store sales using machine learning techniques.
Synthetic retail sales data was used to analyze sales patterns and forecast future sales.
Models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were implemented and
evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics. XGBoost achieved the best performance,
making it suitable for retail sales forecasting and decision support.

## Main Objective
To design and implement a machine learning model that accurately predicts retail store
sales and supports inventory planning and business decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
